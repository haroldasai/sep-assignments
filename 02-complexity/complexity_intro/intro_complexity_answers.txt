1. Describe an analogy for relating an algorithm that has efficiency O(1) and another algorithm that has O(2n).
    An algorithm that has O(1) is light and an algorithm that has O(2^n) is sound.

2. In plain English, what is the best case scenario for binary search?
    When the target is found in the middle of an array.

3. In plain English, what is the worst-case scenario for binary search?
    When the target is found at the first or the last element of an array.

4. In plain English, what is the bounded-case scenario for binary search?
    When the target is found between the first and the middle or between the middle and the last element of an array

5. Create a graph using the data below.

6. What is the limit of the function above as n approaches infinity?
    infinity

7. What is the Big-O of an algorithm that has the data points above?
    O(2^n)

8.
def worst-case_number_of_iterations(n)
  puts n

9. Create a graph from the output using Google Sheets or other graphing software. Analyze the graph and denote its Big-O somewhere on the graph.

10. What is the Big-O of binary search?
    O(logn)

11. What is the Big-Ω of binary search?
    Ω(logn)
