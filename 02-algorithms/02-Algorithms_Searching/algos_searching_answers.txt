1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

7 iterations


2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

2 iterations


3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

fib(10):  55
fib(11):  89
fib(12): 144

1. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

Linear search and iterative.
Collection is unsorted so only linear search can properly find the target.


2. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

Binary search and recursive.
Binary search is faster because searching array gets smaller exponentially on each iteration.
